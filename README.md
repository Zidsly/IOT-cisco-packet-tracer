# Smart IoT Networking in Agriculture

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Smart IoT Networking System** in agriculture using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. By utilizing network simulations and hardware simulations, this project illustrates how agricultural tools and devices can be integrated into a smart network to improve efficiency and automation in farming practices.

The goal is to showcase the potential of IoT (Internet of Things) in agriculture, where interconnected devices and sensors enable the monitoring and automation of agricultural processes.

## System Summary
This project leverages **Cisco Packet Tracer**, a powerful simulation tool developed by Cisco Systems, to design and configure IoT networks for agricultural applications. Cisco Packet Tracer enables users to:
- Simulate network topologies.
- Configure routers, switches, and IoT devices using a simulated command-line interface (CLI).
- Visualize and test IoT systems in a virtual environment.

### Internet of Things (IoT)
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical objects or "things" embedded with sensors, software, and technologies to connect and exchange data over the internet. In this project, IoT principles are applied to agriculture, creating a simulated smart agricultural system to demonstrate:
- Automated irrigation systems.
- Environmental monitoring (e.g., soil moisture, temperature).
- Real-time data communication between sensors and control systems.

## Features
- **Network Design**:
  - IoT devices connected through intermediate network devices such as routers and switches.
  - Realistic simulation of IoT-enabled agricultural tools.

- **Simulated IoT Devices**:
  - Devices representing agricultural tools integrated into the network.
  - Data exchange and monitoring capabilities for agricultural processes.

- **Cisco Packet Tracer Integration**:
  - Full utilization of Cisco Packet Tracer for designing, simulating, and visualizing the IoT network.
